Testing and Automation devroom is coming again to
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/). This room is about building better
software through a focus on testing and automation at all layers of
the stack. From creating libraries and end-user applications all the
way down to packaging, distribution and deployment. Testing and
automation is not isolated to a single toolchain, language or
platform, there is much to learn and share regardless of background!
