Testing and Continuous Delivery devroom is coming again to
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/). This room is about building better
software through a focus on testing and continuous delivery practices
across all layers of the stack. The purpose of this devroom is to
share good and bad examples around the question
“how to improve quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments”
and to showcase new open source tools and practices.

**Note:** for FOSDEM 2024 this devroom is a merger between the former
*Testing and Automation* and *Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment*
devrooms and is jointly co-organized between devroom managers in previous FOSDEM editions!
